                <h1>EVENTS AND SHOWS</h1>
                <p>With the idea of imparting programming knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain, an IIT Roorkee alumnus started a
                    dream, GeeksforGeeks. Whether programming excites you or you feel stifled, wondering how to prepare
                    for
                    interview questions or how to ace data structures and algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a one-stop
                    solution.
                    With every tick of time, we are adding arrows in our quiver. From articles on various computer
                    science
                    subjects to programming problems for practice, from basic to premium courses, from technologies to
                    entrance examinations, we have been building ample content with superior quality. In a short span,
                    we
                    have built a community of 1 Million+ Geeks around the world, 20,000+ Contributors and 500+ Campus
                    Ambassadors in various colleges across the nation. Our success stories include a lot of students who
                    benefitted in their placements and landed jobs at tech giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic
                    network
                    of geeks and we are only a fraction of it yet.</p>
